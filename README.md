# sunburst-and-range-plot
testdata.* contain different datasets for sunburst plot

sunburstplot.m and rangedotplot.m are the main m-files to generate these plot types

plotdemo.m contains sample cases on ways to use the two main m-files.

distinguishable_colors.m is only used to generate colors in case they are not supplied. The original MATLAB FEX link is:
